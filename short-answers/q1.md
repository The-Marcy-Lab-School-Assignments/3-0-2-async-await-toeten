# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
With `asynch/await` we are able to write code in a more "synchronous" manner. We are also able to reduce the amount of callback functions needed, allowing us to avoid common mistakes that happen when writing callbacks.
