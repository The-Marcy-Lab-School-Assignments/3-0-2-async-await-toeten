# Question

Will the code work? Why or why not?

```js
const getUsers = async () => {
  const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users';
  const users = await fetch(url).then(r => r.json()).catch((err) => []);
  console.log(users)
  return users;
}
getUsers()
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer
The following code will run. The .then block will receive a promise from the fetch (because it is awaited) and will return the repsonse in JSON format due to the use of implicit return.
